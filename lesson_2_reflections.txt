Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1: Git initializes an empty git directory, and then informs you that the files contained within are not 
yet tracked.  I assume this is the first step in using git for version tracking and creating commits.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2: The staging area basically contains only the files you are currently working on and will want to track changes that 
are made to them.  This allows you to control specifically which files are included in each commit.
